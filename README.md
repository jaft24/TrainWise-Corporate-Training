# TrainWise-Corporate-Training

This is a back end script in R that will register an arbitrary number of employees for training programs so that everyone gets the skills they need. 
This is done in a way so that no employee is scheduled to register for two programs that interfere and that no more than 3 employees are registered for any single program.
The overall schedule minimizes the total cost of registering all employees for the programs that will get them their required skill sets; thus overall, saving time, energy, and money for the organization.

This program will takw input Excel files with the following names: 
programConflicts.xlsx 
skillsNeeded.xlsx 
skillsOffered.xlsx

You can check what the overall structue of the excel files look like in the test cases.
This program is sufficiently flexible to output an optimal solution to the program given inputs of unknown size.
